Changes made to SoloRedGameModel class for this assignment:

- changed the fields made from private to protected so they could be accessed in the
  AdvancedSoloRedGameModel class.

- Made private fields for gameWon and gameLost and updated them whenever the game
  is supposed to be either won or lost (fixed an error I have been encountering since the model hw)
